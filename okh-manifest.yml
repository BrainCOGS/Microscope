title: "TWINKLE: An open-source two-photon microscope for teaching and research"
description: We document a fully open, high-performance and cost-effective research and
  teaching microscope without any custom parts beyond what can be fabricated in
  a university machine shop. The instrument features a large field of view,
  using modern objectives with a long working distance and large back-aperture
  to maximize the fluorescence signal.
intended-use: Two-photon Imaging in Neuroscience, and as an instrument for training,
  learning and education.
